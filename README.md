# Michael Crum's Portfolio Website

Uses a custom built html generator, found in index.js. Posts from the /posts directory are crawled, 
and the markdown for each entry is populated into the templates from the /templates folder.
The end result is written to the /docs folder, which is served by github pages.

The system was designed for simplicity and maintainability, avoiding the head-ache inducing hellscape that is javascript frameworks.
